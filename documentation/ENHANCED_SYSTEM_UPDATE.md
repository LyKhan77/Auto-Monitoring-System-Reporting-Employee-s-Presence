# Enhanced Face Recognition System - Update Documentation

## Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Face Tracking
- Implemented persistent face tracking with consistent IDs across frames
- Improved bounding box smoothing for multi-person detection
- Reduced "jumping" or "colliding" bounding boxes
- Better handling of face detection when people move slightly

### 2. Employee Database Integration
- Each employee now has a unique database ID
- Enhanced registration process with ID feedback
- Improved employee data management

### 3. Activity Monitoring & Tracking
- Added `EmployeeTracking` class for monitoring employee presence
- Real-time employee status tracking
- Activity duration calculation
- Absent employee alerts (configurable threshold)

### 4. Dashboard Integration Preparation
- Created modules for future dashboard integration:
  - `employee_monitoring.py`: Core monitoring functionality
  - `dashboard_integration.py`: Dashboard data preparation
  - `enhanced_tracking_config.py`: Configuration management

### 5. Parameter Improvements
- Increased default `bbox_smoothing_factor` from 0.7 to 0.85
- Added enhanced tracking parameters
- Prepared configuration presets for different environments

## New Features for Future Dashboard

### Employee Tracking
- Real-time presence monitoring
- Camera location tracking
- Entry/exit time tracking
- Duration calculation

### Activity Alerts
- Configurable absent employee alerts
- Real-time alert generation
- Alert history management

### Reporting
- Detailed employee activity reports
- Camera status monitoring
- System health monitoring

## Files Added

1. `employee_monitoring.py` - Core employee activity monitoring
2. `dashboard_integration.py` - Dashboard data preparation
3. `enhanced_tracking_config.py` - Configuration management

## Configuration Parameters

### Enhanced Tracking Parameters
- `bbox_smoothing_factor`: 0.85 (increased from 0.7)
- `max_distance_threshold`: 100 pixels

- `movement_threshold`: 5 pixels

### Environment-Specific Configurations
- Office environment optimized settings
- Dynamic environment settings
- High accuracy configuration presets
